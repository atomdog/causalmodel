All states can be described as either:c
* Actions (Originate from within the self) -> Can be triggered to manipulate current state position
* Stimuli (Observations, interactions, changes in sensor value) -> Cannot be triggered by the model

According to Hume:
* Cause must be contiguous to effect -> Assuming that any arbitrary state can lead to any other arbitrary state, the graph must be well connected
* Cause precedes effect -> Our graph must be directed

According the the Multiple Clock Theory, we measure time in several different ways. We can define a set of clocks as the following:

* Short term (measured in seconds)  
* Mid term (minutes
* Long term (hours)
* Extra long term (days)

Each clock can be bounded by a constant, which can be refined during model run-time.
